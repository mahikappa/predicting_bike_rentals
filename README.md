# Predicting Bike Rentals

Predicting bike rentals
Many U.S. cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities. The District collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.

Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto compiled this data into a CSV file, which you'll work with in this project. The file contains 17380 rows, with each row representing the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day. You can download the data from the [University of California, Irvine's website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

In this project, we'll try to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. we'll predict the cnt column using all of the other columns, except for casual and registered. To accomplish this, we'll create a few different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
